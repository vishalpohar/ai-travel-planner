# 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication

* JWT-based Authentication
* Password Hashing using bcryptjs

### Authorization

Every trip is associated with a user.

Example:

```js
{
  userId: ObjectId
}
```

Users can only access their own:

* Trips
* Activities
* Packing Lists
* Generated Itineraries

All trip queries are scoped by:

```js
{
  _id: tripId,
  userId: req.user.id
}
```

This prevents unauthorized access to other users' data.
